# ZK AidShield — Claim Aid, Not Your Identity

> Privacy-preserving humanitarian disbursement on Stellar. Prove eligibility with zero knowledge. Reveal nothing.

**Stellar Hacks: Real-World ZK · DoraHacks · June 2026**

---

## The Problem

Humanitarian aid systems leak data. Names, ID numbers, and claim records end up in databases that get hacked, sold, or handed to hostile actors. In conflict zones, a paper trail can be lethal.

ZK AidShield removes that paper trail entirely — using real zero-knowledge cryptography, not just encryption.

## What It Does

A beneficiary proves two things — they are on an approved list, and they haven't claimed before — **without revealing who they are**. No name, address, or ID ever touches the blockchain.

- **Aid operators** get cryptographic fraud resistance: replay attacks are impossible by construction
- **Beneficiaries** get dignity and safety: zero PII on-chain, ever
- **Auditors** get verifiable claim counts without seeing who claimed or when

## Why This Can Win

ZK AidShield is a complete aid disbursement workflow, not only a ZK primitive demo:

- **Real payout path:** valid proof triggers an XLM transfer from Soroban escrow
- **Wallet-bound privacy:** credentials and nullifiers are bound to the claimant wallet without revealing identity
- **Fraud resistance:** double claims and wrong-wallet claims are blocked
- **Auditor visibility:** contracts, campaign root, VK hash, stats, and trust boundaries are inspectable
- **Field-ready credential delivery:** operators can export JSON or passphrase-protected mobile QR credentials
- **Production path:** documented next steps for issuer governance, vendor/voucher mode, and optional identity adapters

See [docs/JUDGING_NOTES.md](docs/JUDGING_NOTES.md), [docs/THREAT_MODEL.md](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md), and [docs/COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md](docs/COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md).

## Judge Demo Script

> **Setup:** Two browser windows — one as the **Operator** (Admin tab), one as the **Beneficiary** (Claim tab). Both need [Freighter](https://freighter.app) set to **Testnet**.

### Step 1 — Operator: Issue a Credential (~30 seconds)

1. Open `http://localhost:3000/admin` in browser A
2. Scroll to **Issue Beneficiary Credential**
3. Paste the beneficiary's Stellar address (or use your second Freighter account)
4. Click **Issue Credential**
5. A signed credential appears — enter a QR passphrase, then click **Download**, **Copy JSON**, or **Download QR**

> _What happened:_ The server signed a credential binding the Merkle witness (secret + path) to that specific wallet using Ed25519. The secret never left the server. The browser received a signed token.

### Step 2 — Beneficiary: Load and Verify (~5 seconds)

1. Open `http://localhost:3000/claim` in browser B
2. Connect Freighter — make sure it is the **same wallet** as the address in step 1
3. Enter the QR passphrase if using QR, then upload a credential file, scan a QR image, or paste the credential directly
4. Click **Verify & Load Credential**
5. You should see: `✓ Credential verified — slot #0`

> _What happened:_ The frontend verified the Ed25519 signature client-side, confirmed `claimant_address` matches the connected wallet, and checked the expiry. No server call was made.

### Step 3 — Beneficiary: Generate Proof (~15–30 seconds)

1. Click **Generate ZK Proof & Claim →**
2. Watch the spinning rings — a Groth16 BLS12-381 proof is being computed in your browser via WebAssembly
3. The progress bar shows an asymptotic estimate (proof generation has no intermediate callbacks)
4. When done: `✓ Groth16 proof (384 bytes): 0x…`

> _What happened:_ snarkjs ran the circom circuit in WASM. The secret is a private input — it never appears in the proof. The public outputs are: Merkle root, disbursement ID, nullifier (wallet-bound), and claimant address.

### Step 4 — On-chain Settlement (~10 seconds)

1. Freighter pops up — click **Approve**
2. The transaction is sent to Stellar testnet
3. Success screen: **"Aid claimed! 🎉"** with a link to Stellar Expert

> _What happened:_ The Soroban disbursement contract called the Groth16 verifier via `bls.pairing_check` (native BLS12-381 host function). The verifier confirmed the proof. The disbursement contract checked the nullifier is fresh, wrote it to persistent storage, and released 1 XLM from escrow.

### Step 5 — Replay Attack Demo (~5 seconds)

1. Click **Try again** on the success screen
2. Load the **same credential** again
3. Click **Generate ZK Proof & Claim →**
4. After proving, you will see: _"This claim has already been used — nullifier found on-chain."_

> _What happened:_ The nullifier `Poseidon(secret, disbursement_id, claimant_address, 1)` was stored permanently on-chain after the first claim. The contract rejected the duplicate before it could double-spend.

### Step 6 — Wrong Wallet Demo (optional, ~10 seconds)

1. In browser B, switch Freighter to a **different** wallet account
2. Paste the credential from Step 1 (which was issued to the original wallet)
3. Click **Verify & Load Credential**
4. Error: _"Credential issued to GXXXX… but your wallet is GYYY…"_

> _What happened:_ The signature check passed (the credential itself is valid), but the `claimant_address` field in the credential does not match the connected wallet. The credential is rejected before any proof is generated.

## How It Works

```
Aid operator builds a Poseidon Merkle tree of beneficiary secrets (off-chain)
        ↓
Merkle root committed to Soroban disbursement contract
        ↓
Operator issues signed credentials — each binds a secret + Merkle witness
to a specific beneficiary wallet via Ed25519 signature (POST /api/issue-credential)
        ↓
Beneficiary loads credential in browser → signature verified locally
        ↓
circom circuit runs in-browser via snarkjs WASM (Groth16 · BLS12-381):
  ├─ Private inputs:  secret, merkle_path[8], path_indices[8]
  └─ Public inputs:   disbursement_id, merkle_root, nullifier, claimant_address,
                      expires_at, issuer_key_id

Constraint 1 — Merkle membership (wallet-, expiry-, and issuer-bound leaf):
  leaf = Poseidon(secret, disbursement_id, claimant_address, expires_at, issuer_key_id)
  merkle_verify(leaf, path, indices) == merkle_root

Constraint 2 — Nullifier correctness:
  nullifier = Poseidon(secret, disbursement_id, claimant_address, 1)
        ↓
384-byte Groth16 proof submitted to Stellar testnet
        ↓
AidShield Verifier contract:
  └─ bls.pairing_check(g1s, g2s)  — native BLS12-381 host function on Soroban ✓
        ↓
AidShield Disbursement contract:
  ├─ disbursement_id matches campaign ✓
  ├─ merkle_root matches on-chain value ✓
  ├─ issuer_key_id is active in the issuer registry ✓
  ├─ expires_at has not passed according to ledger time ✓
  ├─ nullifier is fresh (written to persistent storage after claim) ✓
  └─ claimant_address matches transaction signer ✓
        ↓
XLM released to beneficiary via Stellar Asset Contract
```

> **Security note:** `campaign.json` contains private claim secrets. It is `.gitignore`d and must **never** be committed or shared publicly.

## Running Locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js ≥ 20, Freighter browser extension (set to Testnet)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies and start the web app
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

```bash
# 2. Run the frontend test suite (14 tests — credential + API logic)
cd apps/web
npm test
```

```bash
# 3. Generate a new campaign (creates campaign.json — keep private)
cd packages/merkle-tools
npm run generate
```

```bash
# 4. Test Soroban contracts
cd contracts/disbursement && cargo test
cd contracts/verifier-groth16 && cargo test
```

```bash
# 5. Full Phase 4 deployment to testnet (fresh verifier + fresh disbursement)
export ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=S...
bash scripts/setup-phase4.sh
```

```bash
# 6. Deploy only the Groth16 verifier (after circuit rebuild)
export ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=S...
bash scripts/deploy-groth16.sh
```

### Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values:

```bash
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
# Edit .env.local — set contract addresses, keys, and campaign parameters
```

The app ships with testnet fallback values in `constants.ts`, so it works without `.env.local` for the deployed demo campaign.

## Credential System

The operator's API route (`POST /api/issue-credential`) signs a credential JSON with an Ed25519 key. The signing key lives only on the server — it is never bundled into the frontend.

Each credential contains:
- `version`, `campaign_id`, `claimant_address` — binding fields
- `secret`, `merkle_path`, `path_indices` — proof witness (private to beneficiary)
- `issued_at`, `expires_at` — validity window
- `issuer_public_key`, `issuer_signature` — Ed25519 authentication

The claim frontend verifies the signature before generating any proof. An invalid, expired, or wrong-wallet credential is rejected immediately — the secret is never handed to the prover.

## Trust Model

See [`/audit`](http://localhost:3000/audit) for the full trust model breakdown, including:
- What is enforced on-chain vs. off-chain
- Attack resistance analysis (replay, forgery, wallet-switching)
- Known limitations at hackathon scope
